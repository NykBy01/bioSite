          <p>As far as hobbies go Kimberly does not have very many of them. Between work and school she has very limited free time. That is why one of the hobbies she has is playing games on her phone. Play phone games is pretty simple and easy as mostly all she has to do is take out her phone and open the game pp she wants to play. Phone games can be quick and she can often play them during her breaks at work or as a quick mind break when completing her school work. Another good thing about phone games is that because they are available anywhere she can even use it as a time waster when she is out and about. The games that she enjoys playing on her phone are things like matching games and also online versions of card games. By playing the online versions of cards games she not only has fun, but can also get in some practice for when she plays them with her family.</p>

          <p>Another hobby of Kimberly's is playing cards. Kimberly has been playing cards ever since she was a little girl. Cards has become a very big part of family time for her. When her kids were younger she taught them to play cards too. There are many different card games that they play, but to name a few there is canasta, spades, three thirteen, and gin. Now that her mother is older she spends a lot of her free time at her mothers house to play card games with her. On holidays the family will get together and play cards.

          </div>
          <p>Kimberly also likes to watch Tv. The free time that she has which is not spent playing cards with her mother is instead spent watching tv with her daughter. Kimberly loves shows with drama and she watched many soap operas when she was younger. Since growing up she has stopped watching soap operas and instead turned more towards sitcoms. ANother type of show that she enjoys was introduced to her by her daughter and that is anime. Her eldest daughter liked anime and even introduced her hyounger daughter to it when she was in kindergarten. Her son also got into anime, so for Kimberly there was no escaping it and she ended up becoming a fan as well. When it comes to anime she loves romance. AAnime served as a stepping stone to other types of shows from other countries. Starting with Japanese dramas Kimberly expanded to Korean, chinese, and Taiwanese dramas as well. She really liked the romance and the drama that the shows had. The next type of shows she got into were because of her youngesgt daughter and those shows are bl dramas. BL stands for Boy's Love and those dramas are ones where at least on of the main couples is a gay couple. Kimberly watches Bl dramas from Thailand, Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea. With so many different types of shows to watch and different countries her watch list has grown and grown. She spend a lot of time watching Tv because there are so many shows to get completed.</p>

          <p>As far as hobbies go Kimberly does not have very many of them. Between work and school she has very limited free time. That is why one of the hobbies she has is playing games on her phone. Play phone games is pretty simple and easy as mostly all she has to do is take out her phone and open the game pp she wants to play. Phone games can be quick and she can often play them during her breaks at work or as a quick mind break when completing her school work. Another good thing about phone games is that because they are available anywhere she can even use it as a time waster when she is out and about. The games that she enjoys playing on her phone are things like matching games and also online versions of card games.</p>

              <p>Kimberly Byers took quite a long time to finally realize her goal. She had tried going to college after high school, but when she got pregnant she quit.
                   She took time off to raise her family. Throughout the years she tried one more time to go to college, but that fell through as well. It wasn't until 20 years later that she finally decided she was serious about college. 
                   The reason she realized that she wanted to really get a degree was her youngest child. She wanted to set a good example for her daughter, because her older two children had not gone to college and gotten a degree. 
                   She also found that when homeschooling her youngest child starting in middle school there was a lot she didn't know. She thought going back to school would help her give her daughter a better education. 
                   When she went back to college she needed to decide what she wanted a degree in. SHe first went for programming, but soon realized that it was not for her. After that she thought more about what job she wanted. She liked data entry and she did like coding. Soon she decided on Medical coding and then she started her journey with a brand new goal in mind.

                <p>After realizing what her goal was she started on the path toward it. Starting with getting an AA degree. she already had one from when she was going for programming, but that degree didn't expand in the ways she wanted, so she needed a new one. It took a couple of years to get back to colklege after some personal life got in the way. She also moved states in that time. From Maryland to Kentucky. By the time she got back to school her youngest had graduated and was also going to college. They studied together for their placements tests and now it was her daughter teaching her. After they felt good about their knowledge they went and took their placement tests. Both of them were now going to college. Kimberly was able to find a good program for her goal and she had taken her first steps toward it. That was two years ago and since then Kimberly has completed her AA degree. Kimberly's next step toward her goal is getting her bachelor's degree and her certification. She is in college once again and is working toward her bachelor's, but she has yet to get her medical coding certification.

                        <p>Kimberly has made many steps toward her goal and she continue to make more and get closer to her goal everyday. She has already gotten her AA Degree and a few certificates that can help her get a job. Currently Kimberly is working at a place that does the billing for the UK Hospital. Working at this job she is able to see and become familiar with certain medical codes, but she is not doing the medical coding herself. This is a good way for her to get some knowledge of codes before entering the field. She has talked to the people she works with and has already got her foot in the door for a medical coding position, but she need to first finish the Bachelor's degree that she is going for and get her offical certification before she will actually be able to get the position. Kimberly hasn't obtained her goal yet but she is very close to it. </p>

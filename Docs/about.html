          <p>Kimberly is 50 years old and that means that her current goal was of course not her first goal in life. Before she decided on medical coding, about 20 years before, She was going to college for accounting and her goal was to be an accountant. That was a goal that she did not complete, because she realized it wasn't actually something she wanted to do. There have been goals in her past that she has completed though. When she was a little girl her goal was to grow up and be married. That goal was one she completed twice actually. ANother goal that she had back when she was a little girl was that she wanted to have children. She also was able to obtain that goal and she has three children now. These goals may be more personal goals, but they ar4e still important to her, because she cares very much about her family.</p>

          <p>Kimberly would describe herself as first a mother and second everything else. She is a student in college and she is an employee at her company. These things are important, but they still don't gve much insight to her personality. Kimberly is a kind person and while she used to be very non confrontational when she was younger, as she got older that has sort of gone away. As a mother she certainly has had her bad times, but overall she loves her children very much and tries to do what she thinks is best for them. She wants her children to lead good happy lives. Kimberly is very  driven and hardworking when it comes to school and her job. She strives to do the best she can do and raise that bar constantly seeking to improve. She has becoming more confident in herself in these past few years and more independent as well. I think all these things are important aspects of who kimberly is.</p>

        <h2>Kimberly's future goals</h2>
        <p>We have gone over Kimberly's past goal and her current goals, but what about her future goals? Kimberly is quickly approaching the obtainment of her current goal, so what comes next? Next is rest. After she gets her degree and certification and her job in medical coding she hopes to work for awhile and then retire. No more schooling and no more job searching. ANother thing that she hopes to achieve is becoming a grandma. Kimberly cares a lot about her family and she wishes to have grandchildren. Of course for this to happen children would have to be aa part of her children's future goals as well. Lucky for her it seems that is the case for at least two if not all three of her children. So those goals seem to be obtainable goals as well.</p>
